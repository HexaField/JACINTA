- **Project Title:** JACINTA (Joint Autonomous Coding, Inference, and Notary Task Agent)
- **Architecture & Components:**
  - **Persistent Background Process:**
    - Runs continuously as a background service.
    - Exposes a FastAPI server for task management.
  - **Task Management & Persistence:**
    - Uses SQLite with SQLAlchemy to store tasks persistently.
    - Tasks include a title, description, and status ("pending", "current", "completed").
  - **CLI Interface:**
    - Built with Typer to support commands such as:
      - `jacinta list completed`
      - `jacinta list current`
      - `jacinta list pending`
      - `jacinta new`
      - `jacinta cancel <task_id>`
  - **Configuration Module (src/config.py):**
    - Loads and persists GitHub repository and API key configurations via a config.ini file.
  - **Runtime Module (src/runtime.py):**
    - Ensures the specified GitHub repository is cloned.
    - Initializes the local model using LangChain.
    - Integrates a local LLM via Ollama targeting deepseek r1’s smallest model.
    - Contains agent functions for generating code, performing web research, and processing pending tasks.
  - **Database Module (src/db.py):**
    - Defines the task schema (including a description field) and initializes the SQLite database.
- **Model Integration:**
  - **Local LLM via Ollama:**
    - Uses deepseek r1’s smallest model.
    - Initialized through LangChain’s `init_chat_model` with `model_provider="ollama"`.
    - Model is invoked with `model.invoke(prompt)`.
- **Installation Script (install.sh):**
  - Sets up system dependencies and a Python virtual environment.
  - Installs required Python packages (including LangChain with OpenAI extras, Ollama, GitPython, Playwright, Scrapy, Doit, APScheduler, FastAPI, Uvicorn, Typer, Requests, SQLAlchemy).
  - Checks if Ollama is already installed and skips re-installation if it is.
  - Pulls deepseek r1’s smallest model via Ollama.
- **Task Processing:**
  - Scheduled jobs process pending tasks by:
    - Marking tasks as "current".
    - Sending task descriptions as prompts to the model.
    - Updating task statuses to "completed" upon successful processing.
- **Future Directions:**
  - Expand task-specific functionalities and integrate additional processing logic.
  - Enhance CLI commands and improve overall system robustness.
